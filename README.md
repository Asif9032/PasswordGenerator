# üîê Strong Password Generator CLI Tool

A secure and customizable command-line interface (CLI) tool to generate strong passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, special characters, digits, and more.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Generate strong passwords with customizable length  
- ‚úÖ Option to include special characters (`!@#$%^&*`)  
- ‚úÖ Option to include digits (`0-9`)  
- ‚úÖ Save password to a file  
- ‚úÖ Copy generated password to clipboard (requires `pyperclip`)  

---

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
cd password-generator
```

2. Install required dependencies (for clipboard support):

```bash
pip install pyperclip
```

> Note: The script will still work without `pyperclip`, but copying to clipboard will be disabled.

## üß∞ Usage

### 1. **Interactive Mode (No Flags)**

Run the script without any arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

You'll be prompted to provide settings like password length, whether to include digits or special characters, etc.

---

### 2. **Command-Line Arguments**

Generate a password directly using flags:

```bash
python password_generator.py -l 16 -s -d -f password.txt -c
```

#### Available Options:
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-l`, `--length` | Length of the password (minimum 6) |
| `-s`, `--special` | Include special characters |
| `-d`, `--digits` | Include digits (0-9) |
| `-f`, `--file` FILE | Save password to a file |
| `-c`, `--clipboard` | Copy password to clipboard |

Example:
```bash
# Generate a 12-character password with special chars and digits, copy to clipboard
python password_generator.py -l 12 -s -d -c
```

---

## üìÅ Saving to File

Use the `-f` option to save your password to a file:

```bash
python password_generator.py -f my_password.txt
```

The password will be written to the file in plain text.

---

## üìã Clipboard Support

To copy the password directly to your clipboard, use the `-c` flag:

```bash
python password_generator.py -c
```

Ensure you have `pyperclip` installed for this feature to work.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

- If the provided password length is less than 6, the program will exit with an error.
- If clipboard functionality fails, it gracefully continues without interruption.
- If no valid character sets are chosen (letters only), generation will fail securely.
